# HanttCo AWS Windows EC2 Terraform Deployment

## Purpose  
This project automates the deployment of a **Windows EC2 instance in AWS** using **Terraform**, ensuring security, scalability, and modularity. The setup includes private networking, IAM roles for access control, and best practices for AWS resource management.

## Author: AbuTalha  

## Project Overview  
This Terraform-based infrastructure sets up a **Windows EC2 instance within a private AWS subnet**, ensuring **secure access and controlled traffic routing** via a **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**. The deployment follows **AWS best practices**, including:  
âœ… **VPC with Public & Private Subnets**  
âœ… **Windows EC2 instance in private subnet**  
âœ… **Security Group allowing RDP (3389) & HTTPS (443)**  
âœ… **IAM Role & Instance Profile for AWS SSM access**  
âœ… **Network Load Balancer (NLB) handling inbound traffic**
